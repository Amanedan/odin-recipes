    <h3>Spaghetti is one of the staple dishes most north american families ate quite a bit growing up, I myself was a difficult child
        and would only want to eat pasta, so to say I ate alot of it.
        </p>
        My family would make it the cheap way, no fancy sauce with a bunch of stuff like gross veggies mixed in, just a simple 4 ingredient pasta
        that tasted amazing. On this page I will tell you how we made it, and you can give it a try yourself and let me know by getting in touch
        at the bottom of the page.

        <li>Secondly take your beef and start browing it in your frying pan, make sure its cooked through and theres no pink!</li>
        <li>Next your going to get your sauce ready by opening up the can of tomato soup</li>
